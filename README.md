# One Day In Chicago

We are currently experiencing technical difficulties after Heroku updgrade to MonogoLab 3. Fixes are in progress.

## Preface

Many students choose Northwestern because of the great city of Chicago that is nearby. However, once students arrive at Northwestern, they do not go to Chicago because they don't know how to get there and also what types of activities they can do on a constrained time schedule. One Day In Chicago solves this problem by proposing mini itineraries for parts of the day that include an activity and a restaurant to eat at, while also offering directions to each place.
